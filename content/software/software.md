# Software

During my academic studies and work experience I made extensive use of R and Python for building packages, data analysis, web scraping and app development, in addition to other programming languages such as C++, MatLab and STATA. For code related to my research project visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/albicaron).

I also employ R Shiny for building App for data analytics purposes. Get a glimpse of what Shiny can do by having a peek at [R Shiny Gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/).
