# Software

During my academic studies and work experience I made extensive use of R and Python for building packages, data analysis, web scraping and app development, in addition to other programming languages such as C++, MatLab and STATA. 

I employ R Shiny for building App for data analytics purposes. Get a glimpse of what Shiny can do by having a peek at [R Shiny Gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/).

### **R Packages**
- [`SparseBCF`](https://github.com/albicaron/SparseBCF): implements Sparse Bayesian Causal Forests [(Caron et. al., 2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06573.pdf).

- [`pbcf`](https://github.com/albicaron/pbcf): implements Probit version of Bayesian Causal Forest [(Hahn et. al., 2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.09523.pdf). Based on code by [Starling et. al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09405.pdf).


### **Python**
- [`olearner`](https://github.com/albicaron/olearner): implements a doubly-robust learner [(Caron et. al., 2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06472.pdf), named Overlap-Learner, for estimating individual treatment effects and policy learning.
