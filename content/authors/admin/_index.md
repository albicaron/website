I am a third-year PhD Student in Statistics & Machine Learning at the [Department of Statistical Science, University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/) and [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/enrichment-students/alberto-caron), under the supervision of [Ioanna Manolopoulou](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucakima/) and [Gianluca Baio](http://www.statistica.it/gianluca/) (intake: September 2019). Previously, I worked as researcher and consultant at the [The Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources, UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/bartlett-school-environment-energy-and-resources). I graduated with a Master of Science in Econometrics in 2017 and with a Bachelor of Science in Economics in 2015, both from [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/) (Milan, Italy).

My research mainly involves combining the two fields of Machine Learning and Causality, with particular focus on Probabilistic Machine Learning and Bayesian Nonparametric methods. 

I am currently working on methodology and extensions of Causal Machine Learning algorithms for Off-Policy Learning and for predicting Individualized Treatment Effects (ITE). Estimation of the effects of an intervention at an individual level is of interest in many disciplines (precision medicine, socio-economic sciences, personalized marketing, etc.) where learning heterogeneous response, in order to design highly-personalized optimal policies, is crucial.

## Consultancy Projects
I worked on a few research/consultancy projects commissioned by the [UK governmental Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy), performing statistical and econometric evaluation of environmental/energy policies. I have worked (or I am currently working) on a number of consultancy projects involving statistical analysis and App development for customized data analytics (mainly through [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/)).

## Teaching
I am (or I have been) serving as a Teaching Assistant for the following courses at UCL:
- STAT0001: Economics II
- STAT0006: Linear Models
- STAT0007: Stochastic Processes
